# Debugging

Sometimes your JupyterHub deployment doesn't behave the way you'd expect.
This section provides some tips on debugging and fixing some common problems.

## Verbose logging

You can increase the level of detail in logs emitted by various pods (hub, proxy, autohttps, and user pods) by adding this to your configuration:

```yaml
debug:
  enabled: true
```

This is particularly useful if JupyterHub has started but you have problems with authentication, singleuser servers or services. A downside to enabling this is that the amount of logs emitted will make it harder to read logs for an overview and will increase the costs of a system setup to collect and store logs.

## Debugging commands

In order to debug your JupyterHub deployment, you need to be able to inspect
the state of the resources being used. The following are a few common commands
for debugging.

**Real world scenario:** Let's say you've got a JupyterHub deployed, and a user
tells you that they are experiencing strange behavior. Let's take a look
at our deployment to figure out what is going on.

### `kubectl get pod`

To list all pods in your Kubernetes deployment:

```
kubectl get pod --namespace <k8s-namespace>
```

This will output a list of all pods being used in the deployment.

**Real world scenario:** In our case, we see two pods for the JupyterHub
infrastructure (`hub` and `proxy`) as well as one user
pod that was created when somebody logged in to the JupyterHub.

Here's an example of the output:

```
$ kubectl get pod --namespace <k8s-namespace>
NAME                                READY     STATUS         RESTARTS   AGE
hub-3311438805-xnfvp     1/1       Running        0          2m
jupyter-choldgraf                   0/1       ErrImagePull   0          25s
proxy-1227971824-mn2wd   1/1       Running        0          5h
```

Here we can see the two JupyterHub pods, as well as a single user pod. Note
that all user pods will begin with `jupyter-`.

In particular, keep an eye on the `STATUS` column. If a given
pod contains something other than `Running`, then something may be wrong.

In this case, we can see that our user's pod is in the `ErrImagePull` state.
This generally means that there's something wrong with the Docker image that
is defined in `singleuser` in our helm chart config. Let's dig further...

### `kubectl describe pod`

To see more detail about the state of a specific pod, use the following
command:

```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> --namespace <k8s-namespace>
```

This will output several pieces of information, including configuration and
settings for the pod. The final section you'll see is a list of recent
events. These can be particularly informative, as often an error will
show up in this section.

### `kubectl logs`

If you only want to see the latest logs for a pod, use the following command:

```
kubectl logs <POD_NAME> --namespace <k8s-namespace>
```

This will show you the logs from the pod, which often contain useful
information about what is going wrong. Parse these logs
to see if something is generating an error.

When you have identified the error edit your `config.yaml` if necessary, then run a helm upgrade:

```
helm upgrade --cleanup-on-fail jhub jupyterhub/jupyterhub --version=<chart-version> -f config.yaml
```

where `jhub` is the helm release name (substitute the release name that you
chose during setup).

```{note}
Depending on the size of the Docker image, this may take a while to complete.
```

Right after you run this command, let's once again list the pods in our
deployment:

```
$ kubectl get pod --namespace=<k8s-namespace>
NAME                                READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
hub-2653507799-r7wf8     0/1       ContainerCreating   0          31s
hub-3311438805-xnfvp     1/1       Terminating         0          14m
jupyter-choldgraf                   0/1       ImagePullBackOff    0          12m
proxy-deployment-1227971824-mn2wd   1/1       Running             0          5h
```

Here we can see one `hub` pod being destroyed, and another (based
on the upgraded helm chart) being created. We also see our broken user pod,
which will not be deleted automatically. Let's manually delete it so a newer
working pod can be started.:

```
$ kubectl delete pod jupyter-choldgraf --namespace <k8s-namespace>
```

Finally, we'll tell our user to log back in to the JupyterHub. Then let's
list our running pods once again:

```
$ kubectl get pod --namespace <k8s-namespace>
NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hub-2653507799-r7wf8     1/1       Running   0          3m
jupyter-choldgraf                   1/1       Running   0          18s
proxy-deployment-1227971824-mn2wd   1/1       Running   0          5h
```

And now we see that we have a running user pod!

Note that many debugging situations are not as straightforward as this one.
It will take some time before you get a feel for the errors that Kubernetes
may throw at you, and how these are tied to your configuration files.
